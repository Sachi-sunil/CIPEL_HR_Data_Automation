# 📂 All Data File Automation

### 🚀 Automated Data Ingestion, Cleaning, Transformation & Storage System

The **All Data File Automation** project was developed for **VDart’s Delivery Excellence team** to completely automate the ingestion, cleaning, transformation, validation, and storage of large-scale data files.

This automation replaced repetitive manual workflows with a fast, reliable, and scalable pipeline, leading to massive improvements in speed, accuracy, and operational efficiency.

---

## 🔍 Overview

This system automates the entire lifecycle of handling high-volume data files:

* File ingestion
* Cleaning & standardization
* Transformation & mapping
* Validation & error reporting
* Database loading
* Web-based UI for upload and monitoring

It eliminates manual bottlenecks and enables teams to focus on strategic tasks instead of repetitive data cleanup.
